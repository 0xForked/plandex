## 🌟 Build large features and entire projects faster with AI.

🔮 Plandex is an open source, terminal-based AI programming engine with long-running agents, context management, versioning, branches, diff review, a protected sandbox for changes, and automatic file updates.

💪 Plandex helps you churn through your backlog, work with unfamiliar technologies, get unstuck, and spend less time on the boring stuff.

🏎️ Plandex keeps you, the developer, in the driver's seat. LLMs get better at coding every day, but they still make a **lot** of mistakes. Good results require significant hand-holding. Rather than assuming LLM output will always be great, Plandex focuses on the inevitable failure cases, offering easy escape hatches and corrective options when a plan goes off the rails or a file patch doesn't get generated quite right. Plandex tightens the feedback loop between the programmer and the AI, making it quick and easy to review changes, reject mistakes, and get a wayward task back on track.

🧠 Plandex relies on the OpenAI API and requires an `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable. Support for open source models, Google Gemini, and Anthropic Claude is coming soon.

✅ Plandex supports Mac, Linux, FreeBSD, and Windows. It runs from a single binary with no dependencies.

## Install 📥

### Quick install

```bash
curl -sL https://plandex.ai/install.sh | bash
```

### Manual install

Grab the appropriate binary for your platform from the latest [release](https://github.com/plandex-ai/plandex/releases) and put it somewhere in your `PATH`.

### Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/plandex-ai/plandex.git
cd plandex/app/cli
go build -ldflags "-X plandex/version.Version=$(cat version.txt)"
mv plandex /usr/local/bin # adapt as needed for your system
```

### Windows

Windows is supported via [Git bash](https://gitforwindows.org) or [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about).

## Get started 🚀

If you don't have an OpenAI account, first [sign up here.](https://platform.openai.com/signup)

Then [generate an API key here.](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)

```bash
cd your-project
export OPENAI_API_KEY=...
plandex new
```

After any plandex command is run, commands that could make sense to run next will be suggested. You can learn to use Plandex quickly by jumping in and following these suggestions.

## Usage 🛠️

[Here's a quick overview of the commands and functionality.](./USAGE.md)

## Help ℹ️

To see all available commands:

```
plandex help
```

For help on any command:

```
plandex [command] --help
```

## Why Plandex? 🤔

- 🏗️ Go beyond autocomplete to build complex functionality with AI.
- 🚫 Stop the mouse-centered, copy-pasting madness of coding with ChatGPT.
- 📑 Manage context efficiently in the terminal.
- ⚡️ Ensure AI models always have the latest versions of files in context.
- 🪙 Retain granular control over what's in context and how many tokens you're using.
- 🚧 Experiment, revise, and review in a protected sandbox before applying changes.
- ⏪ Rewind and retry as needed.
- 🌱 Explore multiple approaches with branches.
- 🏎️ Run tasks in the background or work on multiple tasks in parallel.
- 🎛️ Try different models and model settings, then compare results.

## Limitations ⚠️

- Plandex is only as smart as the underlying model. As long as the best AI models are still making all kinds of mistakes when coding, Plandex will also make mistakes. Used judiciously, Plandex can provide a huge boost to your productivity, but as with any other AI tool, you shouldn't expect perfect results. Always review a plan carefully before applying changes, especially if security is involved. Plandex is deliberately designed to get you 80-95% of the way there rather than 100%.

- Due to the error-prone nature of LLMs, automatically applied file updates also aren't perfect. While it's likely these can be improved over time with better prompting strategies (contributions welcome!!), and **will** be improved over time as models get smarter, be prepared for occasional updates that aren't quite right. Use the `plandex changes` command to review pending updates in a TUI. If a file update has mistakes, make those changes yourself with copy-and-paste and reject the file in the changes TUI.

## License 📜

Plandex is open source under the MIT License.

## Plandex Cloud ☁️

Plandex Cloud is the easiest and most reliable way to use Plandex. You'll be prompted to start an anonymous trial (no email required) when you create your first plan with `plandex new`. Trial accounts are limited to 10 plans and 10 AI model replies per plan. You can upgrade to a full account with your name and email.

Plandex Cloud accounts are free for now. In the future, they will cost $15 per month after the trial ends.

## Self-hosting 🏠

[Read about self-hosting Plandex here.](./HOSTING.md)

## Security 🔐

Plandex Cloud follows best practices for network and data security. And whether cloud or self-hosted, Plandex protects model provider API keys (like your OpenAI API key). [Read more here.](./SECURITY.md)

## Privacy and data retention 🛡️

[Read about Plandex Cloud's privacy and data retention policies here.](./PRIVACY.md)

## Roadmap 🗺️

- 🧠 Support for open source models, Google Gemini, and Anthropic Claude in addition to OpenAI
- 🤝 Plan sharing and team collaboration
- 🖼️ Support for GPT4-Vision and other multi-modal models—add images and screenshots to context
- 🖥️ VSCode and JetBrains extensions
- 📦 Community plugins and modules
- 🔌 Github integration
- 🌐 Web dashboard and GUI
- 🔐 SOC2 compliance
- 🛩️ Fine-tuned models

This list will grow and be prioritized based on your feedback.

## About the developer 👋

Hi, I'm Dane. I've been building and launching software products for 17 years. I went through YCombinator in winter 2018 with my devops security company, [EnvKey](https://envkey.com), which I continue to run today. I'm fascinated by LLMs and their potential to transform the practice of software development.

I live with my wife and 4 year old daughter on the SF peninsula in California. I grew up in the Finger Lakes region of upstate New York. I like reading fiction, listening to podcasts, fitness, and surfing. I started Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu recently and am pretty absorbed with that these days as well.

## Possible co-founder? 😎

I'm looking for a technical co-founder or two with experience in some combination of Golang|Devops|TypeScript|React|AI/ML to help me get Plandex off the ground as an open source project, a product, and a fun, WFH-friendly company. If you're interested, please reach out (dane@plandex.ai) or jump in and start contributing.

## Possible employee? 👩‍💻

While I'm not currently hiring for Plandex, I hope to in the future. If you're an experienced Golang or TypeScript engineer and are interested in working remotely on Plandex for a salary at some point with a group of smart, nice, and fun people, please reach out (dane@plandex.ai) or jump in and start contributing.

## Possible investor? 💰

I'd love for Plandex's users and contributors to own a significant share of the cap table. Please reach out (dane@plandex.ai) if you're an angel investor and are interested in investing.
