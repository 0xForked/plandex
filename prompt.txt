In 'deploy.sh' it seems that the tag will not be added on the 'px cdk deploy
  "plandex-stack-*" line.                                                     
                                                                              
  I'm thinking a better idea would be to generate the tag in the deploy script
  and then pass it to the cdk script with an environment variable. Please make
  the updates.
